The project aims to develop a 3D interactive scene using Three.js, featuring a room setup with a 
couch and a lamp. Users can interact with the scene by changing the texture of the couch upon 
clicking. Key requirements include creating a realistic 3D environment with optimized memory 
usage to prevent performance bottlenecks. Additionally, textures should be preloaded to enhance 
performance, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions.
